Info:
	This program achieves multi threading using a simple divide and conquer scheme wherin a larger array is split up into multiple smaller arrays and then they are sorted concurrently and merged.
Compiling:
	Build and run in linux using $make, this also opens up the data that has just been generated. Just be warned it takes a while for the largest arrays to be sorted with the inefficient means.
Efficiency:
	Bubble and Insertion Sort unthreaded are O(n^2), and Merge and Quick(cpp) sort are O(nlogn). The threaded variants are harder to find out however.
